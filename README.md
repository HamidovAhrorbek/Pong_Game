🕹️ Pong Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module. It’s a two-player game where players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. The first player to miss the ball gives the other player a point.


🚀 Features

* Two-player gameplay (Right: ↑ & ↓, Left: W & S)

* Ball bounces off paddles and walls

* Scorekeeping for both players

* Game resets ball position when a point is scored

* Built with clean, object-oriented code


📁 Project Structure

pong/

*  main.py             # Main game loop
*  paddle.py           # Paddle class
*  ball.py             # Ball class
*  scoreboard.py       # Scoreboard class
*  EADME.md            # Project overview (this file)


🧠 How It Works

* Paddles: Controlled using the keyboard (W/S for left, Up/Down for right).

* Ball: Moves automatically and bounces when hitting the top/bottom walls or paddles.

* Score: Updated whenever a player misses the ball.


🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x

This project uses Python's built-in turtle module, so no additional packages are needed.
